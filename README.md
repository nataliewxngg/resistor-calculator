# RESISTOR CALCULATOR
Released December 30 2022 !

Description:
RESISTOR CALCULATOR, a pyinstaller .EXE application, is a Python GUI designed to calculate resistor values (3, 4, 5 bands). As of first release, more features + band counts will be implemented in the future!

Installation:
1. Install the github repository directly as a ZIP
2. Unzip the ZIP folder in your directory
3. The application, RESISTOR CALCULATOR.exe, is stored in the 'dict' folder
4. Run the application!
(Optional)
5. For ease of access, a shortcut of the application was also created in the main directory
6. Move the shortcut into your desktop
7. Run the application from your desktop!  

Instructions to Use the Application:
- In the menu, there are 3 different options for calculation: 3, 4, or 5 bands. 
- Once a button has been clicked and selected, the user will be brought into a different page containing the number of bands. AKA, where the calculations will begin. 
- To change the color of each band, click on the band/box to select it, then press your left and right arrow keys to navigate between a limited amount of colors. 
- Continue this process for all bands until the resistor value is prepared for calculation. 
- Press the 'calculate' button to calculate the resistor values
- Continue to change the colors if needed
- Press 'return' to return to the menu and access other calculators
